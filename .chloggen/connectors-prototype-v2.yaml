  - Connectors connect pipelines. A connector acts as exporter and a receiver working together.
  For example, a `nopconnector`` may be used to replicate signals by exporting data from one
  pipeline and receiving the data on two other pipelines, which can each process a copy of the data
  in different ways.
  Connectors can also derive one signal from another. For example, a `countconnector` can be used as
  an exporter on a logs pipeline and emit metrics, describing the number of logs, onto a metrics pipeline.
